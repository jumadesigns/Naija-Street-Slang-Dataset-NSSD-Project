# Naija Street Slang Dataset Project 🇳🇬🔥

Welcome to the **Naija Street Slangs Dataset (NSSD)** project! This is an open-source initiative aimed at collecting, curating, and expanding a dataset of Nigerian street slangs, their meanings, and real-life usage.

---

## 🎯 Goal

The goal of this project is to build and train models that can understand and generate typical **Naija (Nigerian) street slang**, which is a vital part of Nigerian street culture and everyday communication.

This dataset includes:
- Nigerian Pidgin
- Nigerian English
- Code-mixed slangs (Pidgin + English + Igbo/Yoruba/Hausa influence)

## 🤝 How You Can Contribute

I believe that everyone, regardless of coding knowledge, can contribute to this project. Whether you're a Nigerian, a language enthusiast, or someone who just loves slang, your input is welcome.

### ✅ Add New Slangs
If you know a Naija street slang that’s not already in the dataset, feel free to add it. We accept slangs with their meanings and usage examples.

### ✅ Verify Existing Slangs
Help ensure the accuracy of the dataset by reviewing slangs that others have added. You can suggest corrections or improvements where needed.

### ✅ Suggest New Categories
If you think categories (like **Greetings**, **Insults**, **Compliments**, etc.) should be included, let us know.

## 📝 How to Contribute (No Coding Required)

For those who don’t know how to code or use GitHub, we’ve made it easy to contribute.

### Option 1: Use the Online Form (Easy Way)
We’ve set up a Google Form where you can submit new slangs or update existing ones. Just fill in the slang, meaning, and a usage example.

📌 Submit here: **(Google Form Link)**

### Option 2: Create an Issue on GitHub (Intermediate Way)
If you're familiar with GitHub, you can open an issue and share the slang you want to add. A maintainer will handle the rest.

### Option 3: Pull Requests (Advanced Way)
If you're a developer, you can clone the repo and directly add entries to the dataset file, then submit a pull request for review.

## 📦 Dataset Format

The dataset is stored in a simple and structured format. Each slang entry includes:

- **Slang/Term**: The street slang word or phrase  
- **Meaning**: A brief translation or explanation  
- **Example Usage**: A sentence showing how it’s used  
- **Category**: The type of slang (e.g., Greetings, Insults, etc.)

This structure helps keep the dataset easy to understand and use for training machine learning models.
